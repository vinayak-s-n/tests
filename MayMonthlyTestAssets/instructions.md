# May Monthly test - Bookmark landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[AttainU](https://attainu.com)'s monthly test allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (desktop and mobile)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Available for

1. **Desktop** ![desktop](./design/desktop-active-states.jpg)
2. **Mobile** ![mobile](./design/mobile-active-states.jpg)

Follow the hover states of buttons, links, logos except the error message design shown in newsletter form (before footer) and the FAQ dynamic user interaction thing, but you must show the design atleast for one question's expanded answer in code, to show how will it result .

For this challenge you'll need to:

- Create the rounded blue background shape with code
- Change the `fill` and `stroke` color of the SVGs at specific points (the challenge can be completed using the single `logo-bookmark.svg` file provided). Refer [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes) to learn more about it.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

2. **This is super optional** Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel). We've got more information about deploying your project with Vercel below.

3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.

4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.


## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.
